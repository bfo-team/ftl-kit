# Freemarker Development Suite (ftl-suite)
> Make freemarker development efficiently and conveniently

## How to use? Only 3 steps!
1. Make sure Java is installed on your machine (version 1.4 or later)
2. Install ftl-suite `npm install ftl-suite --save-dev`
3. Start services `[PORT=80] node node_modules/ftl-suite`

## Feature
1. Render FTLs in local server without IDE
2. Analog data based on interface documentation, parallel development with back-end
3. Proxy Ajax to the remote server
4. Super Route
5. Restore the online environment perfectly

## Configurations
When you start service for the first time, ftl-suite will create a config file named **fsconfig.json**. You can edit it directly or visit http://127.0.0.1[:port]/_tools/

Default config:
```
{
    "ftlRoot": "ftl",
    "route": {},
    "globalData": {}
}
```

### ftlRoot
freemarker root folder, e.g.
```
"ftl" or "../main/ftl" etc.
```

### route
You can make urlRewrite for all requests, you can also use this to mock ajax local data or proxy to remote server.It is an amazing super router!
```
{
    "/user/home": "/html/user/home/main.html",
    "/api/user/\?id=(\d+)": "http://server/api/user/?id=$1",
    "/ajax/getList/\?id=(\d+)&type=(\w+)": "/mock/ajax/getlist_$1_$2.json"
    
}
```
Note: Using RegExp as matching rules. You should escape the special characters except "/", such as "?". See more details in "index.js" at line 62.

### globalData
Global data for all FreeMarker templates

## Rendering
When you visit an URL in browser, the service will find the appropriate FTL, rendering from a json file in the same path in "mock/data".

e.g.

```
visit: /main/index.html
ftl: /ftl/main/index.ftl
data: /mock/data/main/index.json
```

Note:

1. Prefixed with "static,src,mock,htm,html,tool,tools" will return static files
2. To avoid errors, it is recommended to use the "_tools" to edit configuration
3. Java SimpleDateFormat is not supported when mock data.
